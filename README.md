### What Is It?


Capture the Ether is an interactive game designed to teach Ethereum smart contract security through hands-on hacking challenges.

The game offers a variety of challenges across multiple categories, each represented by a smart contract. The objective of every challenge is to manipulate the contract so that its `isComplete()` function returns true.

This repository provides possible approaches for solving the challenges.
